abstract: The movements of mitochondrial are especially critical for neuronal growth and function. However, to analyze and quantify this process is technically challenging. Different from traditional hand-drawn method which lacks efficiency, we focus on automatic methods, which consist three key aspects (image enhancement, trajectories tracking and quantitative analyzing) and provide a discussion about different issues in these steps.
