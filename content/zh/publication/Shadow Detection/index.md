abstract: The existing shadow detection methods have achieved good results on standard shadow datasets such as SBU and UCF. However, in actual large-scale scenes, key objects covered by shadows are often regarded as shadows, which may harm computer vision tasks. In the paper, we are the first to propose the Object-aware Shadow Detection Network (OSD-Net) model for computer vision tasks in complex scenes. It introduces the direction-aware spatial context (DSC) module to detect shadows, uses semantic segmentation with Mask RCNN to extract key objects in the picture, and designs a function to perform mask fusion. Qualitative experiments have been performed to test OSD-Net on three public datasets commonly used in computer vision. Compared with popular shadow detection methods, OSD-Net is able to effectively protect the key targets in the picture from being misjudged as shadows, and ensure shadow detection accuracy.
